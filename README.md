This repository contains my first major project—a basic personal portfolio website featuring a dedicated "Contact Me" page.

Creating a multi-page website (index.html and contact.html).

Using basic HTML elements like lists (<ul>), tables (<table>), links (<a>), and images (<img>).

Implementing a simple contact form using the <form> element.

Goal: To demonstrate proficiency in structuring web content before moving on to styling with CSS.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 (Pure HTML)
